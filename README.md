An application addon to run Cloudstream extensions on Nuvio, Stremio, and every other Stremio-supported platform.

> **Note:** This app is currently in the alpha stage. You may experience bugs or crashes. Join our community to report issues! If you are a developer, PRs for fixes are always welcome.

## Downloads

CNCVerse Bridge is available for Android and Desktop (Windows/Linux).

Go to the **[Releases](../../releases)** page to download:
- **Android:** Download the `.apk` file.
- **Desktop:** Download the `.msi`/`.exe` for Windows or the `.deb` for Linux (Debian/Ubuntu and derivatives).

---

## Getting Started (Android)

1. **Install and Run:** Install the downloaded `.apk` and open the CNCVerse Bridge app.
2. **Start Server:** The app will run a local server in the background and display an addon URL on the screen (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8080/manifest.json`).

### Usage with Stremio

1. Copy the addon URL provided in the CNCVerse Bridge app.
2. **Important:** Stremio needs HTTPS: set up your Cloudflare Tunnel (see [Stremio Mode](#stremio-mode-https-through-your-own-cloudflare-tunnel)) and enable the "Stremio Mode" toggle.
3. Open the **Stremio** app and go to the **Addons** section.
4. Paste the copied URL into the search bar or addon URL field.
5. Tap **Install** to add the CNCVerse Bridge addon.

### Usage with Nuvio

1. Ensure the CNCVerse Bridge app is running in the background.
2. Open the **Nuvio** app.
3. Nuvio will automatically detect the local CNCVerse Bridge addon—no manual URL pasting is required!

---

## Getting Started (Desktop — Windows & Linux)

1. **Install and Run:** Install the `.msi` (Windows) or `.deb` (Linux), or run the desktop app from the distribution folder.
2. The app will launch and display the server status and the local addon URL.
3. **Same-Device Streaming:** If you run Stremio on the same computer, you can click the **Add to Stremio** button or manually add `http://127.0.0.1:8080/manifest.json` in Stremio.
4. **Local Network Streaming:** You can also use the Desktop app to host the bridge for other devices on your Wi-Fi network. Simply use the local IP address shown in the app (e.g., `http://192.168.1.100:8080/manifest.json`) on your TV or phone.

### ⚠️ Desktop Limitations

Currently, the Desktop version lacks full **WebView support**. This means:
- Features relying on Cloudflare bypass will use the system browser (Chrome/Chromium/Edge/Brave are auto-detected on Linux) instead of a hidden WebView.
- FebBox / ShowBox login flows that require a web interface open in the system browser.
For full compatibility with these specific providers, please use the Android version.

## Stremio Mode (HTTPS through your own Cloudflare Tunnel)

Stremio (especially Stremio Web) needs an HTTPS addon URL. Stremio Mode serves the bridge through **your own** Cloudflare Tunnel and domain:

1. Add your domain to Cloudflare (the free plan is enough).
2. In the Cloudflare dashboard open **Zero Trust → Networks → Tunnels → Create a tunnel** (Cloudflared).
3. Copy the token from the install command (the long text after `--token`).
4. Under **Public Hostname** add e.g. `bridge.yourdomain.com` → service **HTTP**, URL `localhost:8080`.
5. In the app open **Settings → Cloudflare Tunnel**, paste the token and the hostname, and save.
6. Turn on **Stremio Mode** on the Server tab. Your addon URL is `https://bridge.yourdomain.com/manifest.json`.

The app downloads `cloudflared` on first use.

## What's in the app

- **Server** — start/stop, addon URLs for Nuvio (LAN) and Stremio (HTTPS), Stremio Mode
- **Extensions** — repositories, search & install, update all, install a whole repo, switch extensions on/off, per-extension settings
- **Logs** — live log with copy/clear
- **Settings** — Cloudflare Tunnel, streams (resolutions, CAM, size limits, non-seekable files, subtitles, sorting, extension priority), catalogs (hide all or pick which ones; genres come from each home page, refreshed every 30 min), stream formatter (on by default, presets and preview), stream cache

---

## New in 1.2.0

- **Anime** - kitsu / MAL / AniList / AniDB ids are matched against every title the show is known by (English, romaji, synonyms) with fuzzy matching, season handling and flexible episode numbering, so extensions such as AniPM and Anidap find more shows and the right episode. Settings -> Streams: *Anime audio* (subbed / dubbed first, or hide the other).
- **Quality** - adaptive HLS links get their real resolution from the playlist (no more "Auto" at the bottom), optional one-entry-per-rendition listing, a resolution cap ("Best quality for this device": links above it are listed last), and an option to hide unknown quality.
- **Backup & import** - Settings -> Backup & import saves every setting (filters, formatter, cache, media server, repositories, installed / disabled extensions, extension settings) to one JSON file and restores it, also on another device.
- **Media server** - Settings -> Media server. Links that need a Referer / cookies are downloaded by this device with those headers, kept on disk (hard limit 2 GB) and served to the player from there, with seeking while the download runs. HLS playlists and segments are cached and fetched ahead.

## Building the APK on GitHub

Upload the project to a GitHub repository (branch `main`). The *Build APK* workflow (`.github/workflows/build-apk.yml`) builds an installable APK; get it from the run's *Artifacts* or from the *latest* release. To sign with your own key, add the repository secrets `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64`, `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`, `ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS`, `ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD`; without them the sideload key in `ci/` is used.

## Building from source

```bash
./gradlew :androidApp:assembleRelease                        # Android apk (signed when a keystore is configured)
./gradlew :desktopApp:packageReleaseDistributionForCurrentOS # Windows .msi/.exe or Linux .deb
./gradlew :desktopApp:createDistributable                    # desktop portable folder
```

### Releases

Pushing a version tag builds and publishes everything through GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/release.yml`):

```bash
git tag v1.0.0 && git push origin v1.0.0
```

The Android signing key comes from the repository secrets `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64`, `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`, `ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS` and `ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD`.
